# Materials and Structures Research Group (MASTER)

The [Materials and Structures Research Group (MASTER)](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/MASTER-Erick-I-Saavedra-Flores "ResearchGate") focuses on developing and utilizing modern computational techniques to enhance our understanding of the mechanics of solid materials and perform structural analysis.

The group consist in professors, lecturers and master/undergradutes students of the [Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Santiago (USACH)](https://obrasciviles.usach.cl/master/ "web OOCC"), Chile.

## Research lines
Our research encompasses various topics, including but not limited to:

- Timber materials and structures
- Multi-scale computational mechanics
- Non-linear solid mechanics
- Composite materials and structures
- Plasticity for small and large strains
- Finite elements in structural engineering
- Nanomechanics

## Current work
This organization currently keeps the following research under development:

- Timber connectors using Ansys APDL
- Wood cell wall constitutive modeling
- Homogenization-based multiscale modeling of concrete
- Mixed stabilised finite element formulations

These projects are ongoing research, and most remain confidential until completion. We look forward to making them publicly available once they are finalized.


## Contact
We are very interested in establishing collaboration with enthusiastic researchers! Please feel free to contact the Administrator [Carlos Felipe Guzm√°n](https://linktr.ee/cf.guzman "linktr.ee") if you have any question regarding our work.
